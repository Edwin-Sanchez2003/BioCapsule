# What I Changed
- **face_model:** I changed model parameter loading paths to be hard-references rather than some sort of logical loading. Should change this later.
- **Deep Face for Recognition & Detection:** https://github.com/serengil/deepface -> Links to a library called `Deep Face` that has SOTA face detection & recognition models.
